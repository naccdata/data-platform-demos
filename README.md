# Form Upload Demo Code

Demo code for uploading form data to the NACC Data Platform.

> Note: these projects demonstrate using the Flywheel SDK to connect to the Flywheel instance using code that uploads a file from disk.
> If you plan to upload files this way, you don't need to write your own code, and can instead use the [Flywheel CLI utility](https://flywheel-io.gitlab.io/tools/app/cli/fw-beta/)
